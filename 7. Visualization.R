#scale() function
#Variables (rows or columns) may have different units or magnitudes
#Scaling helps by converting values to z-scores
#This makes heatmap colors and clustering meaningful across rows/columns.
#In R, the scale argument in pheatmap() is crucial for normalizing your data before clustering â€” especially when the variables (rows or columns) are on different scales.
#if we don't use the scale()?
